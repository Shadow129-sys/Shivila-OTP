Frontend
- For the frontend part I tried to keep it as simple as possible.
- The page build can be found at /signinOTP
- I tried to add the "Login with OTP" button on the login page, but doing so really messed up the styling, and it would take a long time to fix to css.

Backend
- /OTPmail gets email address and generater an OTP.
- /VerifyOTP verifies the OTP and logs the user in.
- I have used nodemailer to work with email, as of now i have used ethereal email, and haven't used gmail due to authentication reasons, adding 2 to 3 lines to the existing code will also make it work with gmail.
- Used jwt with an expiry time to store the OTP, so that after a certain amount of time it won't work.
- Added 'OTP' to the user schema.
